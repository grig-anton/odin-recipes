      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have stashed in
        the freezer for when the kids need a quick snack. Easy for little hands
        to hold, with the cheese sealed inside and no tough crusts, theyâ€™re fun
        for them and convenient for you. <br /><br />You will need a sandwich
        sealer for this recipe, and they are easy to find online.

      <h3>Ingriedients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 1</strong>: Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of
          each slice of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly
          smaller than the sandwich sealer, press out round slices of cheese.
          Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface, buttered side down. Place a
          cheese round in the center of each slice. Top with remaining 4 bread
          slices, buttered side up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3</strong>: Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich,
          press the sealer down, and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to
          30 seconds. Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard. Repeat with
          remaining sandwiches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 4</strong>: Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined
          baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer
          bag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 5</strong>: Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193
          degrees C). Cook frozen sandwiches until golden, about 5 minutes. If
          sandwiches are thawed, cook 3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees
          C).
