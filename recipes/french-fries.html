      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Begin by soaking the sliced potato strips in a bowl of water for about
        30 minutes to draw out the starch â€” this ensures the most deliciously
        crispy results. Pat potatoes dry, then add them to a pot of preheated
        oil and fry for five minutes.<br /><br />
        Allow the potatoes to cool before frying them a second time. Let cook
        until golden brown, then blot with a paper towel and salt before
        serving. Double-frying guarantees a wonderful crunch that will keep you
        coming back for more.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 1</strong>: Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water
          for about 30 minutes.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3</strong>: Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to
          275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and
          fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes
          occasionally.
