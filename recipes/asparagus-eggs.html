      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 1</strong>: Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat.
          Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant,
          about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2</strong>: Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender,
          turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3</strong>: Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over
          the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and
          yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 4</strong>: Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined
          baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer
          bag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 5</strong>: Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with
          red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
        </li>
