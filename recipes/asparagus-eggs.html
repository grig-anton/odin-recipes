          <h1>Asparagus and Eggs</h1>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful
            light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and
            topped with two eggs.

          <h3>Ingriedients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 1</strong>: Heat a small skillet over medium-high
              heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is
              fragrant, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 2</strong>: Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender,
              turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 3</strong>: Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs
              over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are
              firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 4</strong>: Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined
              baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a
              freezer bag.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 5</strong>: Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle
              with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
            </li>
          </ol>
